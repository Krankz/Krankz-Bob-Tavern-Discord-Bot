What’s your strategy this time, partner?
My favorite commander is back! Ready to get started?
Better hire a recruit while you can.
It’s not the strongest, but it’ll fight hard.
It’s good to get some minions in play.
That one might make all the difference.
That’s what I would’ve picked.
A good, tactical choice.
I like where you’re going with this.
That’ll do some damage!
That’s quite the army you’re building, friend!
Go big or go home, I always say.
Oh ho! You’re moving up in the world!
Exactly what you were looking for.
That’s a great play. I can’t wait to see this shake out.
Spend wisely. But you know… spend!
It’s a joy to watch you work.
I like how your strategy is shaking out.
I like how you’re handling this one.
I’ve been freelancing since they trashed my place in Dalaran.
Have you ever met the League of Explorers? Nice folk. Great hats.
I’ve dealt with the League of EVIL. Terrible people. But good tippers!
I once served a drink to a Death Knight. It froze over… right in his hands!
You know, I think you could win this whole thing.
How do I attract all these minions? Two words: Funnel. Cakes.
Sorry about the peanut shells on the floor. These minions are slobs.
All the best minions come here. I’ve got the spicy pretzel mustard.
Have a good battle, friend!
Don’t tell the others – I’m rooting for you.
You’re doing great out there!
Keep up the momentum, friend!
I think you can win this thing.
Everyone’s gunning for you. Watch out!
You’ve got this. You’re way ahead!
Let’s see if you can stay on top!
The battle is really raging out there!
Your minions really pulled their weight!
You’re good at this!
Nice work out there! Keep up the pressure.
